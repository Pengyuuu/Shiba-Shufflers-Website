                <p>The Shiba Shufflers, a premiere rag-tag group of friends, is dedicated to keeping the joy and imagination from playing 
                    all genres of games alive. We love to casually play all types of games and provide a competitive environment to showcase 
                    the best of the best, but above all else put having fun and good sportsmanship first.
                </p>

                <p>“Shiba” is inspired by Mochi, the team Mascot and the blissful soft treat she is named after. “Shufflers” represents the 
                    iconic shuffling that is done in trading card games as well as the famous dance move as some of our member’s love all 
                    things dance and the game Dance Dance Revolution.
